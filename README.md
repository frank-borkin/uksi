# Statutory Instruments for the UK

**What is this?**

It's a list of all Statutory Instruments for the UK. They're separated into UK, Wales and NI and amendments are applied as git patches, rather than new files. That means you can see all the current laws on the books, and use any git history tool to see how that law has changed over time.

Which is neat.

I've chosen to use the "Coming into Operation" date for the patches, and that's when the amendments actually kick in. If there's no time, I've used 00:01.
SI's are formatted with Markdown.
If an SI is removed, repealed or entirely replaced, it's deleted.
